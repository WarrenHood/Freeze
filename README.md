# Freeze

**To play, clone the repo and then open index.html with chrome or firefox or whatever browser. (Only tested on firefox)**

The aim of the game is to freeze all of the blocks on the screen while minimizing the sum of the areas of all the blocks by the end.

Click on blocks to freeze them.

NOTE: This was coded from about 12AM until around 4:07AM, and I have no idea why I made this game, and I do not intend to work on it any further.
Enjoy... (Or don't, I don't really care, I wanna sleep!)
